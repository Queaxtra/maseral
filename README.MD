- The last thing left is to run the project, so open the terminal (open the terminal after defining the project) and type **bun run dev** (type this command after bun install).

### Pocketbase Setup
- Download PocketBase from the [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io) site.
- Extract and run the PocketBase executable.
- Access PocketBase admin UI at `http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/`.
- Add to your .env file:
```
VITE_APP_PBURL=http://127.0.0.1:8090
VITE_APP_APIKEY=YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY
```

Since I am using **bun** in the project, I am doing it with bun, you can do it with **pnpm, yarn or npm**
